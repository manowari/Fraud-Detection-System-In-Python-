# Analysis

- Acquire data - You can use kaggle is a good go to source
- If using VS Code - find a good Csv editor and CSV Preview, it will come handy
-  Start by preprocessing the data, get acquanted with the type of variables, number of entries and what they are. This makes gives better insights on the problem being solved 



## **Getting Started**

- Im using a python notebook for routine python calls, you can choose whatever works 
- an IDE or Code Editor like VS will work/ suppliment the above

 ### Step 1 :

- Prepare the data , [here's a manual](data_prep.md) . The data need sto be cleaned and a general idea of the shape. Its important to prepare the data before proceeding as a good model is only as good as its data. 

### Step  2
Choose a model, go through the modelling documentation, remember to start small and progress to more advanced concepts  [here's a manual](modelling.md)
