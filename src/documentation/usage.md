# Setups 
Activate virtual environment

then

This creates a `/venv ` folder 




## Modelling & Outlines

**Requirements**
- You'll need a data set, a large one preferrably
- Find a suitbale model for use basing on how comfortable or requirements of your project
 - modularize your project with empty or filled __init__.py files . Its recommended you  run   `python create_init_files.py  ` as I might not remember to update as the project grows bigger 



**Assumptions**

- A basic understanding of Python
- A basic understanding of Statistic and  how Statistical Methods operate
- A basic understanding of how machines recognize patterns from data 


-

### Setup a Git


` git checkout -b master `

`git add . `

`git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>`

- Commmit and push 



### Installing Libraries 

Various models need different libraries [check out the list here](official_docs/installations.md )

### Data Analysis 
For data analysis, check the [data analysis and preparation page](data_analysis_notes/full_data_analysis.md)

**Main Functions**
I have a main module where you can run some already precompiled method and and more :-)
